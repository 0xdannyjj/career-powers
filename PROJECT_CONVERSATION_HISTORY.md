- Removed unused functions causing build warnings
- Production build successful: âœ… Compiled successfully

### 14. OpenAI Integration Debugging

#### Core Problem Identified
**Issue**: Users always getting default ENFP answers instead of AI-generated results  
**Root Cause**: OpenAI API calls failing silently, fallback mechanism hiding errors

#### Debugging Implementation
- Added comprehensive error logging to OpenAI integration
- Created `[FALLBACK]` markers for default responses
- Built debug API endpoint at `/api/debug/openai` for troubleshooting
- Enhanced error visibility for production debugging

#### Debug Tools Created
**New API Endpoint**: `/api/debug/openai`
- Tests OpenAI API connection and validates environment variables
- Returns detailed error information for troubleshooting

### 15. Current Status & Next Steps

#### Deployment Status
- âœ… **GitHub Repository**: Clean structure, all code pushed
- âœ… **Vercel Deployment**: TypeScript errors fixed, builds successfully  
- ðŸ”§ **OpenAI Integration**: Debugging tools added, requires environment variable verification
- âœ… **Database Schema**: Supabase RLS policies configured
- âœ… **Email Collection**: Working with fallback mechanism

#### Immediate Action Items
1. **Verify OpenAI API Key** in Vercel environment variables
2. **Test debug endpoint** at `/api/debug/openai` on deployed app
3. **Check Vercel function logs** for OpenAI API call errors
4. **Validate complete user flow** from assessment to AI analysis

#### Technical Insights
- Fallback mechanism prevents user-facing errors but masks real issues
- Environment variable configuration is critical for OpenAI integration
- Debug tooling essential for production troubleshooting
- Error logging provides visibility into API failures
